# Calculating-Differential-Methylation

## Overview
This repository demonstrates a simple example of differential methylation analysis using mock Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) data.
From larger WGBS study, site specific comparison may become necessary for a particular genomic regions fo interest.  
This script is appropriate for comparing the SAME genomic regions between two samples. 
It should not be used to compare differential methylation in the same sample across different genes. 

## Purpose
Illustrates the concept of comparing methylation levels across two samples to identify differentially methylated sites. Uses mock data only.

## Tools
- R

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Tabular methylation data handling
- Calculation of delta methylation
- Filtering for significant differences
- Reproducible analysis practices
